<blockquote cite="http://">
  <p>Congratulations to the Seven Music-loving Boys and Their Wings, ‘ARMY’! The songs, dance, dreams and enthusiasm of BTS energized and gave strength to young people around the world. I congratulate BTS on topping the Billboard 200 with their album titled ‘Love Yourself 轉 Tear’. This is the first ever Korean album to claim the top spot, and also the first non-English album to do so in 12 years. <br>

At the very heart of BTS’ outstanding dancing and singing is sincerity. This magical power turns grief into hope and differences into similarity. Each of the seven members sings in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions. <br>

Bangtan, which literally means bulletproof in Korean, was born out of the will to protect teenagers from prejudice and oppression. The names of each member-- Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook -- are going to be remembered for a long time. Thank you to BTS for spreading joy across Korea and the world with your great performances.</p>
<p>&mdash;President Moon</p>

  <p>When I became aware of the BTS phenomenon, it hit me by storm. I listened to their music. I enjoy their music, but I really enjoy the following and the passion they create. I think that's something special. And especially for them to be the first to take K-pop and make it global, that truly is a testament to how well they do their job. So I'm just a fan of what they do and the passion that they evoke out of people. I think it's really special.</p>
  <p>&mdash;John Cena</p>

  <p>Over the past few years, [BTS] has taken the music industry by storm... all the while remaining exemplary ambassadors for their Korean culture. But behind those three letters are seven astounding young men who believe that music is stronger than the barriers of language. It’s a universal dialect. With positive messages of self-confidence, intricacies of philosophy hidden in their sparkly songs, true synergy and brotherhood in every step of their elaborate choreography, and countless charitable and anthropological endeavors, BTS have put their 14 best feet forward as role models to millions of adoring fans and anyone else who finds themselves drawn to BTS’s undeniable allure.</p>
  <p>&mdash;Halsey</p>
