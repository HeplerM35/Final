<h1>Facts About My Favorite Animals</h1>
<div class="div-animal">
<h2>Fox</h2>

<p>Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica and thrive in cities, towns, and rural settings. But despite being all around us, they're a bit of a mystery. In the 1960s, a Soviet geneticist named Dmitry Belyaev bred thousands of foxes before achieving a domesticated fox. Unlike a tame fox, which has learned to tolerate humans, a domesticated fox is docile toward people from birth. Today, you can buy a pet fox for $9000, according to Fast Company. They're reportedly curious and sweet-tempered, though they are inclined to dig in the garden. Foxes make 40 different sounds.</p>

<h2>Lion</h2>

<p>The average male lion weighs around 180 kg (400 lb) while the average female lion weighs around 130 kg (290 lb). The roar of a lion can be heard from 8 kilometers (5.0 miles) away. Lions can reach speeds of up to 81 kph (50 mph) but only in short bursts because of a lack of stamina. A lion’s roar can be heard from as far as 5 miles away.  Even though the lion is sometimes referred to as the “king of the jungle,” it actually only lives in grasslands and plains.</p>

<h2>Wolf</h2>

<p>While the average length of female wolves is 4.5 to 6 feet from nose to tail, males can grow up to 6.5 feet in length. This is partly why they can sprint at speeds of 36 to 38 miles per hour for short distances, though unless they are on the chase they tend to cruise at a more leisurely pace of about 5 mph. Wolves can eat a huge amount, as much as 9 kg, in one sitting. The alpha male is first to eat and will devour the most meat out of the pack, followed by other pack members and or other scavengers.</p>

<h2>Panda</h2>

<p>Giant pandas are omnivores, which means their diet consists of both vegetation and meat. However, bamboo is by far their favourite food. Bamboo is low in nutrients so giant pandas need to eat a lot to survive. In a single day, they can spend 12 to 16 hours eating, consuming up to 44 lb (20 kg) of bamboo. Unlike other bears, giant pandas do no hibernate during winter months, but instead may migrate short distances to lower elevations.</p>

<h2>Horse</h2>

<p>Because horse’s eyes are on the side of their head they are capable of seeing nearly 360 degrees at one time.  When horses look like they’re laughing, they’re actually engaging in a special nose-enhancing technique known as “flehmen,” to determine whether a smell is good or bad. The Przewalski’s horse is the only truly wild horse species still in existence. The only wild population is in Mongolia. There are however numerous populations across the world of feral horses e.g. mustangs in North America.</p>
