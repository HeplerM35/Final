<h1>History</h1>

<h2>History of HTML</h2>
<p>HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing. Then comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.Then comes the HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.Then comes the HTML 4.01 which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012.</p>



<h2>History of CSS</h2>
<p>CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS. Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[25] One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles</p>


<h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme and Self. In late 1995, when Microsoft cottoned-on to the competitive threat the Web posed, the Internet Explorer project was started in an all-out attempt to wrestle control of the emerging platform from Netscape. In so doing Microsoft became a mortal threat, compelling Netscape to respond. First, they started a standardization process to prevent Microsoft gaining control of the JavaScript language. Second, they partnered with Sun to leverage their shared interest in breaking the Microsoft monopoly. Sun began development of Java in 1990 in an attempt to write a language for “smart appliances”. This approach floundered and in 1994, Sun regrouped and set sights on the Web as the delivery platform of choice. So the Netscape/Sun partnership meant Sun acquired the use of a competitive browser and a delivery system for their strategic technology.
Netscape, on the other hand found a powerful ally against Microsoft. They also aimed to out-manoeuvre Microsoft by being the official browser of the highly anticipated platform that was Java.</p>
